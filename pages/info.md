## I got inspired by…

[Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/about/) and his fabulous [themes for jekyll](http://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/). Authors of [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) and [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) since 2002. [GitHub](https://github.com/) and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic](http://automattic.com/) and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more…

#### Since then, fork it!
